// nonce and the browser will simply refuse to execute it.
//
// This only works because the app runs as a persistent Node server

// nothing under a static export, which has no per-request server code to
// generate a fresh nonce.
// Empty by default, and that is the shipped topology: the API is same-origin behind
// `app/api/v1/[...path]/route.ts`, which `'self'` already covers. It becomes a real
// origin only for a split-origin build, where `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is absolute - and

// in. Derived *once* rather than per request for the reason it always was: the
// environment cannot change while the process lives, and `basemapOrigins`' warning for a
// malformed value would otherwise repeat on every request, burying the one diagnostic
// it exists to give.
//
// `accounts.google.com` used to sit beside this on the same terms, in `style-src`,
// `connect-src` and `frame-src`, because Google's sign-in script injected a stylesheet
// and an iframe and called home from the page. No Google code runs here any more - the
// button is a top-level navigation to Google (`lib/google-oauth.ts`) - and a top-level
// navigation is governed by none of the fetch directives, so nothing replaced it. The
// policy now names Google in no configuration at all, which also means the CSP no longer
// discloses whether an instance has Google sign-in turned on.
//
// It reaches `connect-src` and nothing else. There was a second derivation beside this
// one until the site picker moved to MapLibre, feeding the raster tile hosts it drew as
// `<img>` elements into `img-src`; that directive names no third party at all now, and
// the basemap is not what would put one back.
//
// Every `<img>` in this app points at this instance - its own origin, or `apiOrigin`
// where the API is split off onto another one, which `img-src` already lists. Species
// photos are the case that makes the distinction worth stating rather than saying
// "own origin": they are `<img src>` elements pointed straight at the API, because the
// route serving them is deliberately unauthenticated, so in a split-origin build - which
// local dev is - they resolve to `apiOrigin` and not to the page's origin. The bytes are
// Wikimedia's, fetched once by the server and stored here; no browser ever asks
// Wikimedia for them, which is the whole point of serving them ourselves.

      // header-stripping primitive itself was. Without the clause, no request shape
      // yields a CSP-less response.

      // It never covered the prefetches browsers send on their own, either. `matchHas`

      // header up by exact lowercased key, so the `Sec-Purpose: prefetch` that Chrome's

      // them, and the guide calls PPR incompatible with a nonce-based CSP because
      // "static shell scripts won't have access to the nonce" - but nothing here serves
      // a static shell, and the document that runs those scripts mints its own nonce.
