// list, the header's create menu, and the "log a dive here" buttons on a trip or
// a dive site - and a dive from a trip, a site, the Home page and more, so a
// hardcoded `/dives` is wrong for most of them. Rather than each caller
// threading its own href through the page, the destination is read off the URL,
// which means it also survives a reload or a shared link.
//
// Deliberately not `router.back()`: a deep link or a refresh has no history
// entry to pop, and after a successful save "back" points at the form that was
// just submitted.
